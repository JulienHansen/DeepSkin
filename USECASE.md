# Machine Learning Canvas


## Background

Skin cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer, early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Many people around the world lack easy access to proper medical attention.
Our project aims at enabeling our users to determine wheter their mark/lesions is malicious or not and if medical attention is necessary.

## Value Proposition

We propose an application for automatically identifying nature and potential risk assessment of user's lesions. Users do not need to have any medical knowledge. This reduces unnecessary visits for benign cases while ensuring that high-risk cases receive urgent medical attention.
